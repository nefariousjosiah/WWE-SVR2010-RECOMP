## Built into the game's DLLs

`rexruntime.dll` and `rexgpu-xenos.dll` are built from the ReXGlue SDK (commit `c94f5eb` plus
`patches/rexglue-sdk.patch`) and contain these libraries, as the SDK includes them:

| Library | Used for | Licence |

| [FFmpeg](https://github.com/wmarti/FFmpeg) (libavcodec, libavutil), commit `0604b464` | the game's audio (XMA) | LGPL 2.1 or later |
| [libmspack](https://github.com/kyz/libmspack) (LZX decoder), commit `30590772` | unpacking the game's executable | LGPL 2.1 |
| [SDL 3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) | window, controllers, audio output | zlib |
| [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) | on-screen menus (settings, FPS counter) | MIT |
| [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt), [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) | text formatting, logging | MIT |

**The LGPL libraries (FFmpeg, libmspack)** are statically linked into `rexruntime.dll`; this
project doesn't change them. You may replace them with your own versions: their source is at the
links and commits above, and `rexruntime.dll` builds from the ReXGlue SDK source (`setup.ps1` fetches
it and applies `patches/rexglue-sdk.patch`). Put the rebuilt `rexruntime.dll` next to `svr2010.exe`.
