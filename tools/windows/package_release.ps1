$Title - native PC version (Windows; Linux and Steam Deck through Proton)

YOU NEED YOUR OWN COPY OF THE GAME. This download contains none of the files from the game disc
and never downloads any: the game's data (models, textures, sound, video) is read from a disc
image (.iso) of your own disc, USA / Europe release. It does not condone piracy.

Windows
 1. Copy your .iso into this folder, next to $Id.exe.
 2. Run $Id.exe. The game finds the disc image by itself and starts.
 (If there's no .iso here, the game asks for one the first time and remembers it.)

Linux / Steam Deck, through Proton
 1. Extract this folder (on the Deck in Desktop Mode, for example to /home/deck/Games/$Name)
    and copy your .iso into it, next to $Id.exe. The game finds it there by itself.
 2. Steam > Games > Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library > Browse > pick $Id.exe
    (set the file type filter to All files).
 3. The shortcut's Properties > Compatibility > Force the use of a specific Steam Play
    compatibility tool > Proton Experimental.
 4. Start it (on the Deck, from Game Mode). View + Menu together opens the settings menu.
    Optional: bind the L4 back button to F1 in the game's Steam controller layout.

Settings: press F1 in game (or Back + Start on a controller) for the settings menu: resolution
up to 4K, fullscreen or window, 60 or 30 fps, screen shape, FPS counter, sound, keyboard
controls. Saved in $Id.toml.
Saves: the userdata folder (created on first start). If something goes wrong, send game.log.
DLC: if you own SvR 2010's DLC, put your own package files in the dlc folder (see the note there).
