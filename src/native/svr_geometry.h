// SvR 2008: vertex and index buffers for the native renderer's draws.
//
// SvR's D3D (stock XDK 2.0.5632) keeps its buffers as its own guest objects:
//   D3DVertexBuffer (D3DDevice_CreateVertexBuffer sub_82235648): D3DResource + vertex fetch
//     constant: +0x18 = CPU address | 3, +0x1C = size in bytes (bits 2-25) | 0x10000000 | endian
//     (2 = 8in32).
//   D3DIndexBuffer (D3DDevice_CreateIndexBuffer sub_82235770): D3DResource (Common bit 31 =
//     INDEX32, bits 30-29 = endian: 1 = 8in16 for INDEX16, 2 = 8in32 for INDEX32), Address (+0x18,
//     CPU address), Size (+0x1C, exact bytes).
// The CPU addresses are in a physical alias (0xA0000000 / 0xC0000000 / 0xE0000000). The XDK turns
// them into GPU addresses where the GPU reads them: SetStreamSource (sub_8225A648) writes stream
// N's fetch constant into the device, DrawIndexedVertices (sub_825A4340) converts the index buffer
// address into its DRAW_INDX packet.
