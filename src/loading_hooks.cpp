// Loading speed (SvR 2009 and 2010: same engine code).
//
// The engine's graphics object (2009: created by sub_82477B28) guards the D3D device with a lock that
// the loader thread holds while loading. The loader calls sub_82477A18 often: once the time since
// the last presented frame exceeds the budget at +196 (milliseconds: the elapsed timebase ticks are
// divided by ticks per ms), it hands the device and the lock to the main thread for one
// loading-screen frame and waits for it. The budget is 15 ms normally, but match loads set 1 ms
// (sub_820EBD58 and others; one path 0 ms), so the loader worked ~1 ms per 16.7 ms frame. On the
// Xbox 360 the DVD was the bottleneck anyway; here the data is there at once and match loads took
// ~50 s, mostly waiting for frames.
//
// The hook raises the budget the loader is compared against (never lowers it): the loading screen
// still gets a frame every 1/60 s, and the loader gets most of each frame.
